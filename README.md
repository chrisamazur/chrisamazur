Hi I'm Chris Mazur, a Canadian migrant who's settling in Australia. 

I'm interested in wargaming, automating nasty manual tasks, and seeking out all of Australia's interesting animals and creepy-crawlies.

I've moved to tech from labour and am a bit older than your typical jr. dev.  Please feel free to call out anything you think I can be doing better, I appreciate any feedback.
